# Chrono Collapse – A Time-Bending Endless Runner
## Core Premise
The Tower of Time is collapsing, and you, the Chrono Runner, must ascend before time itself unravels. The further you climb, the more unstable reality becomes, causing sections of the tower to break apart, time to rewind, and paradoxes to form.

---

## Gameplay Loop
* Endless Climb: The tower is procedurally generated, with sections breaking apart as you ascend.
* Temporal Hazards: Time anomalies create shifting obstacles, disappearing platforms, and time distortions.
* Time-Bending Abilities: Players can pause, rewind, or fast-forward time in short bursts to navigate hazards.

---

## Game Mechanics

### Movement & Controls
* Standard endless runner controls: Auto-run forward, with player-controlled jump, slide, and dash.
* Time-based abilities (limited by a cooldown or energy system):
* Time Pause: Freezes everything but the player for a brief moment.
* Rewind: Rewinds nearby obstacles (e.g., a broken bridge restores for a moment).
* Fast-Forward: Speeds up platforms/enemies to get past slow-moving hazards.

---

### Tower Sections & Time Anomalies
Each section of the tower gets progressively more unstable, introducing different time-related hazards:

1. Lower Tower (Stable Time)
 * Classic endless runner hazards: crumbling floors, spike traps, and moving platforms.
 * Occasional minor time distortions (e.g., objects flickering in and out of existence).
2. Mid Tower (Temporal Unrest)
 * Platforms start reversing in time (e.g., collapsing then reforming).
 * Enemies that loop their movements due to time anomalies.
 * Time-based puzzles (e.g., a bridge that only exists when rewinding).
3. Upper Tower (Time Breakdown)
 * Reality shifts: sections rewind, loop, or skip forward randomly.
 * Player movement speeds up/slows down unexpectedly (must compensate).
 * Paradoxes spawn—past versions of the player appear and must be avoided.

---

### Scoring & Progression
* Distance-Based Score: The longer you survive, the higher your score.
* Time Fragments: Collectable items that restore energy for time abilities.
* Paradox Events: Surviving anomalies rewards bonus points or unlocks power-ups.

--- 

### Art & Aesthetic
* Stylized pixel art or low-poly neon, with a fractured time theme.
* As players ascend, the world gets glitchier (e.g., visual distortions, color shifts).
* Tower sections randomly flicker between past, present, and future.
---

*** Music & Sound
* Dynamic soundtrack that warps with time distortions.
* Echoing, distorted sound effects for collapsing sections.
* Subtle ticking sound that speeds up as collapse accelerates.

---

### Possible Extra Features (if time allows)
* Boss Encounters: Time Wraiths that chase the player, forcing creative time ability use.
* Alternate Playstyles: Different characters with unique time-based powers.
* Endless Mode vs. Challenge Mode: Structured levels for a story mode, endless for high scores.

### Scope Considerations
* Focus on polishing the core gameplay loop first: running, jumping, and time mechanics.
* Procedural generation can be pattern-based rather than fully randomized.
* Prioritize one or two time abilities rather than all three at first.
