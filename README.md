# Time Loop Tower Defense
 past versions of yourself replay your actions when the loop resets.

Gameplay Mechanics:

* Every loop, you record your own actions, and in the next loop, your past selves repeat those actions automatically.
* Example: In Loop 1, you shoot arrows → In Loop 2, past-you shoots arrows while you set traps → In Loop 3, both past-yous attack while you build walls.
* The challenge is coordinating past versions of yourself for maximum efficiency.
